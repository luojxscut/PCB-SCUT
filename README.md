# PCB-SCUT
The PCB-SCUT dataset consisted of samples collected from real industrial production lines of PCB without using any data augmen. Based on the causes, locations, and morphological characteristics of surface defects, we categorized the defects into 20 types including Open (OP, 0), Mouse Bite (MB, 1), Pin Hole (PH, 2), Residual Copper (RC, 3), Burr (BU, 4), Oxidation (OX, 5), Short (SH, 6), Foreign (FO, 7), Large-area excess copper (LEC, 8), Copper De f iciency (CD, 9), Film (FI,10), Convex-Concave Copper (CC,11), Ex posed Laminate (EL, 12), Scratch (SC,13), Dent (DE,14), Rough Edge (RE,15), Hole Shift (HS,16), Thin Line (TL,17), Block Hole (BH,18), Fuzzy Edge (FE,19).
