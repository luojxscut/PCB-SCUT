# PCB-SCUT
The PCB-SCUT dataset is composed of samples from real PCB industrial production lines, with defect images stored in JPG format and their corresponding design diagrams preserved in BMP format. Based on the causes, locations, and morphological characteristics of surface defects, we categorize the defects into 20 types including Open (OP, 0), Mouse Bite (MB, 1), Pin Hole (PH, 2), Residual Copper (RC, 3), Burr (BU, 4), Oxidation (OX, 5), Short (SH, 6), Foreign (FO, 7), Large-area excess copper (LEC, 8), Copper De f iciency (CD, 9), Film (FI,10), Convex-Concave Copper (CC,11), Ex posed Laminate (EL, 12), Scratch (SC,13), Dent (DE,14), Rough Edge (RE,15), Hole Shift (HS,16), Thin Line (TL,17), Block Hole (BH,18), Fuzzy Edge (FE,19).
